# M'alibi Time Tracker

A time tracking React app.


## How to use

### Configuration

Currently the software stores all the time tracking data in the user's localStorage.
No additional configuration required at this early a phase.

### Using the app

You can start your tracking session by pressing the Start/Pause button of the timer. Each instance of starting or stopping adds a time point to the active session. 

Every two time points create a time interval that can be marked to have been used towards a project. The projects can be assigned to a time interval by dragging and dropping the project from the Projects list to the project slot of the time interval.

There is a Breakpoint button for ending the active time interval and starting another one immediately afterwards for convenience.
